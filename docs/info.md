## How it works

The module (Fig. 1) is fed by two fixed-point numbers, namely af and bf, coverts them into the posit arithmetic [1] format (ap and bp) and sums them to produce a posit output (sp).

![fixed2posit-module drawio](https://github.com/afasolino/tt06_posit/assets/151364130/2e2fa7f1-4080-490b-bbb9-8ac1b462cae2)

It is made of two units: 
1) 16-bit 2's complement fixed-point 0.15 coded to 16-bit standard posit (16,1) converter, namely fixed to posit converter;
2) posit adder, that executes the addition of posit numbers according to the posit standard.

1.
The conversion is operated as described in [1], leveraging a leading zero counter [2] and some glue logic.

2.
The addition leverages the architecture presented in [3].

## How to test

Provide two fixed-point input data and they will be added in posit arithmetic.
